                    integrating
                    technology with education. Imagine having an incredible experience the same way you have at
                    school/institute.You'll be able to do almost anything you can imagine, get together with friends,
                    study,
                    learn, play just by sitting in your room and wearing your VR headsets. We are planning to completely
                    transform this into a new fascinating form of technology which not only helps you to interact with
                    people but also connect with them in a real way. We’ll be able to express ourselves in completely
                    new,
                    joyful, ways. And that’s going to unlock a lot of amazing new experiences.

            <div class="title">Why us?</div>
            <div class="box">
                <div class="text">We all have been deeply affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic.The pandemic has
                    left a deep trace of despair in the minds of many. The economy saw a big downfall as well. One of
                    the most affected sectors was education. Lockdowns imposed a big problem on the schools which led to
                    the start of the era of online classes.
                    <p>
                        Online classes, however, didn't provide the same environment for the kids which they would have
                        got in schools. This has made more and more children lose interest in studies and not take their
                        classes seriously. Moreover, online classes are proving to be detrimental to the health and
                        social skills of the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So we came up with the idea of metaversity, an immersive, evolving 3D world which brings people
                        close to each other and feel a connection with each other even by sitting at their homes.
                        Instead of looking at a grid of videos and attending classes in the boring way, we have made it
                        possible for the children to actually interact with each other.

            <div class="title">What is metaversity?</div>
            <div class="box">
                <div class="text"><div>Our metaverse is a virtual platform for schools and universities. We all got bored by online
                    classes. Now, doing classes virtually by sitting at your home but in a more interesting way. We
                    provide our services to almost all the schools and universities. We help schools and
                    universities by providing them with fully customised plans which include - building the school
                    virtually
                    - bearing the cost of vr/ar products
                    - managing the services
                    Screens just can’t convey the full range of human expression and connection. They can’t deliver
                    that deep feeling of presence. But, metaversity can and here’s how : You put on your glasses or
                    headset and you're instantly in your class, it has parts of your school or universities
                    recreated virtually. Worried about writing your notes? Relax, we got you a digital whiteboard.
                    You can read more features about metaversity below: </div>
                <div>
                    Feel like you’re together with avatars and spatial audio: Feel more connected and have more
                    natural conversations using our new metaversity Avatars and spatial audio technology. The
                    avatars of metaversity feel more natural and expressive rather than static 3d models. They have
                    a lot of customization options, all of which makes the students feel like they are physically
                    present with their classmates. With our new spatial audio technology, you’ll hear the people
                    around you based on where they’re seated, just like they’d sound in a real room.
                </div>

                <div>
                    A virtual whiteboard to keep track of ur creative ideas: Every room in metaversity offers
                    infinite whiteboard space so you can sketch things out together in real time. As you are done
                    with the whiteboard, the whiteboard saves the image locally on your computer.
                </div>

                <div>
                    Customizable classrooms: The whole room scales up and down to fit the size of the class.
                    Students can customise the classrooms to set up a soothing environment for studying.
                </div>

                <div>
                    Join in VR or by video call: Not everyone will always have a VR headset handy, so you can also
                    dial in to a room from your computer by video call. The meeting can be joined just like any
                    other online meet with a meeting link. Video participants will show up on a video screen in the
                    virtual room, just like a real conference room.
                </div>

                <div>
                    Meeting notes, file sharing, and chat: Metaversity will be able to integrate with apps like
                    whatsapp, Outlook and Google Calendar to chat, share files and for calendar integration in the
                    future. This will make the overall environment more productive as things will be managed more
                    efficiently
                </div>

                <div>
